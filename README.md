## About To Do Website
* There is a Create Task page where user create a task. Their is some field like title, description, due date and category. User can select category and then he/she can created a post. All task info will save in a database(mongoDB)
* In home page, there is displaying all tasks that user created before and all information is there.
* Also there is a Action table header and there is 3 button. One is Incomplete button. User can click and button will be Completed. But user only made Completed when it's in Incomplete. That means user can not Completed a button that is already completed
* The second button is for edit. After clicking this button a popup will displayed and user can see all his task's information and able to update his/her task's previous information.
* The last button is for delete. Clicking delete button user can delete his/her task
* Also I'm using beautiful toastify which will show a toast after successfully create task, incomplete to completed, edit and successfully deleted. Also a error toast will apear when user click on Completed button which was already Completed.
